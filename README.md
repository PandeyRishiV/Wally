# Wally 
## The Budget tracking android application
#### Wally is a simple and old android application uograded to work with Android 13 that can help a user log daily income and expenses. 
#### This application was made as my degree project although it can work almost completely as an android application
#### The user can then check the statistics of their expense and income in the reports section.
##### Here are some steps to help you start using the application:
1. To start using the application make sure you use Android studio hedgehog and clone the the repository
2. Open the repository in android studio and build the application
3. Click on run, select your suitable emulator and Wally should be visible on your screen
4. Remember to register before trying to login
5. Once you login, the application will be ready to use, Since it has auto login feature you will only have to login once.

Note: The UI might look old and might break at places, I will work on these if I have ever have free time on my hands. 
Some Screen shots of the application will be added soon
